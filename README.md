The Problem
---

The Kindle doesn't tell you on what page you are in a book but instead tells you on what location you are. That makes sense, since the Kindle lets you read ebooks, and those don't have physical pages. Additionally with customizable text sizes and occasional page breaks, for bigger pictures, the number of locations varies.

However, this behavior makes it difficult for Kindle users to tell their Goodreads followers on what page they currently are in the books they read.

The Solution
---

This program asks the user how many pages the physical book has, what the total number of locations on their ebook is and on what location they currently are, calculates everything together and gives them a rough estimate on what page they would be if they would've been reading the printed copy of their ebook.
